        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These crispy shrimp are rolled in a coconut beer batter before frying. For dipping
             sauce, I use orange marmalade, mustard and horseradish mixed to taste.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>⅔ cup beer</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cups flaked coconut</li>
            <li>24 shrimp</li>
            <li>3 cups oil for frying </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <li>In medium bowl, combine egg, 1/2 cup flour, beer and baking powder. Place 1/4
             cup flour and coconut in two separate bowls.</li>
        <li>Hold shrimp by tail, and dredge in flour, shaking off excess flour. Dip in
             egg/beer batter; allow excess to drip off. Roll shrimp in coconut, and place
             on a baking sheet lined with wax paper. Refrigerate for 30 minutes. Meanwhile,
             heat oil to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) in a deep-fryer.</li>
        <li>Fry shrimp in batches: cook, turning once, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden
             brown. Using tongs, remove shrimp to paper towels to drain. Serve warm with your
             favorite dipping sauce.</li>
